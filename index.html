            Hi, I'm Namayanja Swabulah, an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creating functional and user-friendly websites. I'm currently pursuing a Software Development program through BYU-Pathway Worldwide, where I'm gaining hands-on experience in coding, design, and digital problem-solving.

As part of my learning journey, I'm excited to build my first personal website in WDD 130 (Web Fundamentals). This project marks the beginning of my professional web development portfolio, and I look forward to showcasing my skills and growth as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I'm committed to continuous learning and eager to make a positive impact through technology.
